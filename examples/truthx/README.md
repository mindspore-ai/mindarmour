This is a code with paper link:https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17811. The paper mainly introduces a new method to alleviate the hallucinations of the large language model.In this code,we use llama-2-chat-7b for the original llm and llama-2-7b-chat-truthx for the truthx model to get answers from the questions in truthfulqa,we run the test results by gpt2.In the test result,we can find that truthx makes a great difference in alleviating the hallucinations. The dataset link truthfulqa :https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA, the following detail could be seen in the README.md of the link listed above.
